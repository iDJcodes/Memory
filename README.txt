In order for this Project to run you need the following files in the same folder:
- matchingGameFinal.py
- open.py
- victory2.jpg
- When prompted the program it will ask twice for the background image (user selected image).
	~Reason being that there is a clash in libraries in the matchingGameFinal.py thus 
	~we created open.py and called it in the main program instead.  
- For it to run use Portable Python, that compiler has all the libraries necessary to run the program.
